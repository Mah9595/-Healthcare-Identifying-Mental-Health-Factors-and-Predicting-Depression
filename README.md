# [Healthcare] Identifying Mental Health Factors and Predicting Depression

We see more and more people experiencing mental health issues in today’s society, especially in institutes of higher learning. It seems that although we are progressing in terms of technology, our levels of happiness are regressing.

Can we make a difference by predicting mental health states using data? Yes, we can. 

In this UpLevel project, you will harness data obtained from university students with depression to train a machine learning model to predict one’s mental health state in a campus setting.
